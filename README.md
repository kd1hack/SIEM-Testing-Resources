# SIEM Testing Resources

This repository contains resources for testing the effectiveness of a Security Events and Incident Management (SIEM) solution. These materials include test cases for basic security use cases, tools required for testing, and instructions on how to set up the testing environment.

## Getting Started

To get started, download the document from the **Releases** section and use the test cases to verify the coverage of your SIEM solution.

### Key Features
- **Test Cases**: Structured based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework, covering common security use cases.
- **Tools**: List of essential tools needed for conducting the tests (e.g., Nmap, Metasploit, Netcat).
- **Testing Methodology**: Detailed instructions on how to run tests and monitor SIEM alerts.

## How to Use
1. Download the test case document from the [Releases](./releases) section.
2. Follow the instructions in the document to set up the tools and execute the tests.
3. Monitor your SIEM dashboard in real-time to verify that alerts are generated.
4. Use the validation steps to confirm that alerts have been correctly triggered.

## Tools List
Below is a list of tools that will be required:
- **Nmap**: Network scanning, host discovery
- **Metasploit**: Payload generation and exploitation
- **Netcat**: Data transfer and port scanning
- **SCP/SFTP**: Secure file transfers
- **Hydra**: Brute-force attacks on password protocols
